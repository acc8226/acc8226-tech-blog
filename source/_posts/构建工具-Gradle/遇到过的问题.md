## Use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 7.0.
Use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings.

Just create(open) a file called gradle.properties in your root project. Then add inside that file:
`org.gradle.warning.mode=all`
